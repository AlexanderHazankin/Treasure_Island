# Treasure Island
Welcome to Treasure Island, a text-based adventure game where you must find the treasure and win the game!

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the Python script treasure_island.py using a Python interpreter.
You will be presented with a series of choices at different points in the game, and you must choose one of the options to continue.
The game will end when you reach one of the possible endings, either by finding the treasure or encountering a game over scenario.

## Gameplay
In Treasure Island, you will start at a crossroad where you must choose to go left or right.
If you choose left, you will come to a lake with an island in the middle.
You will then have the option to wait for a boat or swim across the lake.
If you choose to wait for a boat, you will be taken to the island and presented with three doors: red, yellow, and blue.
Each door leads to a different outcome, either finding the treasure, entering a room full of fire, or entering a room full of beasts.
If you choose to swim across the lake, you will be attacked by angry trout and the game will end.
If you choose to go right at the crossroad, you will fall into a hole and the game will end.

## Requirements
Requires Python 3.x to run.
